# Transcriber
Transcriber for meetings using python

# Why?
Well... Sometimes i forget to take notes on meetings XD 

# How it Works
It will listen to yours audios devices and transcribe it. The output will be saved on a file called Output.txt in the same directory of the script.

# Usage 
1) Install Python Latest Version

2) Install PiP : 

Download the get-pip.py script from the official Python website: get-pip.py.

Save the get-pip.py script to a directory on your computer, such as your Downloads folder.

Open a command prompt or PowerShell window:

Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter to open a command prompt.
Press Win + X, then select "Windows PowerShell" to open PowerShell.
In the command prompt or PowerShell window, navigate to the directory where you saved the get-pip.py script. For example, if you saved it in the Downloads folder, use the following command:

cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads
Run the following command to install pip:
python get-pip.py

If you have multiple Python versions installed, you may need to specify the version explicitly:
python3 get-pip.py
After the installation is complete, you should have pip installed on your system. You can verify it by running the following command:

pip --version
This should display the version of pip installed on your system.

Now you should be able to use pip to install packages and manage your Python environment on Windows.

3) Run pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Run the transcriber.py using the command : python transcriber.py

5) Click on the "Transcribe" button

6) Let it running until the meeting ends

7) Type your password defined in the config.yaml file 

8) Click on the Stop button

9) Check the "Output.txt" file
